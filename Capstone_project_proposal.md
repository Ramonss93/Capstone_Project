Potential client: Safety conscious Londoners
--------------------------------------------

Issue: There is no easily accessible way for Londonders to check whether an area is a hotspot for a certain type of crime. This may be in the context of choosing a location to live or checking before heading somewhere for a night out.

Aim: Determine hotspots for crime in central London. Identify whether there are seasonal patterns in the type of crimes occurring and the locations where they occur, plus whether crime types and frequency are changing over time. A visual geographic representation of hotspots would allow the user to be more aware of the potential risks of their surroundings.

This crime and policing dataset is for street level crime and is available for the England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data is reported monthly annd is available from December 2010 to March 2017 at present. Crime data has the date truncated to record only the month and year, and location is only referencing the approximate location using 'anonymous' map points. This is to protect the privacy of victims.

Ideas 2 and 3 both support using an API to acquire the data. The crime data API requires an area polygon to be used and a date range.
